I specialize in reverse engineering and vulnerability research. I am interested in low level security, fuzzing, binary exploitation techniques and mitigations. I also enjoy cryptography.
Previously, I have played CTFs with SHRECS, a team that I created with fellow students of my university. During that time, we helped promoting the CTF culture in CentraleSupélec, and won multiple competitions such as Imperial CTF, HackDay, THCon CTF and Orange CTF.
